## Frame 1 — 你看得懂你的 AI 吗

- scene: 手绘纸面上大标题「你看得懂你的 AI 吗？」，一个 agent 小人涂鸦耸肩，问号便签散落
- voiceover: "你每天让 AI 帮你写代码——可它背着你干了什么，你说不清。有个老哥干脆自己写了一个。"

- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/01-hook.html
- type: hook
- persuasion: Pain validation + curiosity gap
- beat: recognition + intrigue
- blueprint: kinetic-type-beats (Adapt)
- focal: 手写大标题「你看得懂你的 AI 吗？」（hw-title）
- roles: 大标题 = foreground subject（占 ~50%，centered 偏上）；纸面网格+角落涂鸦 = background（压暗 ~35%）；问号便签 ×3 = supporting（落定后 boil）
- sfx: pencil scribble, pop

Adapt: 保留 kinetic-type 的"节拍落字 + 弹出收尾"签名，但改为手写揭示（不是无衬线 slam）。
Scene 1 (0.0–2.6s): cream 纸面 + 极淡网格打底；大标题以 per-word staggered reveal（`dynamic-content-sequencing`）逐词落上，`power3` 长尾；标题词落完即静止。Centered，~50% 画幅。
Scene 2 (2.6–6.3s): 旁白说到"背着你干了什么"——一个方块黑盒涂鸦（`hw-box-label` draw-on）滑到标题右下，三张问号便签依次 pop 进（spring-pop 平滑版）；便签带低幅 boil（`hw-boil` calm）。
Scene 3 (6.3–9.79s): "干脆自己写了一个"——左侧一个手绘小人拿起巨大铅笔（SVG self-draw `svg-path-draw`），铅笔尖冒出一个小星标；全场静止读题，仅 boil 保活。

## Selected blueprint: kinetic-type-beats

# kinetic-type-beats — Kinetic-Type Beats

**intent**: A flat, centered, bold-type shot where the motion IS the word/phrase changing — the line either swaps tokens in place by hard cut, or builds a statement across full-screen beats (each with its own move) that lands a spring-pop payoff.

**roles served**

- Hook (from `hook-kinetic-type-flash`): when one stationary line lands a punchy rhetorical question or "you keep doing X" callout and the in-place token swap itself is the joke.
- Hook (from `hook-kinetic-type-escalation`): when ONE statement should escalate across distinct full-screen beats (each a different move) and punctuate on a spring-pop payoff element — a rising-intensity / "transform X into Y" opener.
- Hook (from `kinetic-type-to-logo-reveal`): when rapid centered word beats are the warm-up for a typography-to-brand arc — the swaps resolve into a logo reveal (pop-in whole, or 3D parts assemble and flatten into the flat mark) that hands off to a value card / browser mockup sliding in.
- Hook (from `centered-beat-triptych`): when the open is three center-stage beats on a constant field, each element ALONE on screen — and a beat's payload may be non-text (a logo-lockup rotation-snap, a CTA button spring-pop with a one-shot glow-ring pulse, a benchmark chart that builds and holds); the last beat holds to the end.
- Problem (from `problem-kinetic-type-beats`): when the script is 3–5 short pain statements (or a "what-if?" framing) that should each land alone, on a bare canvas, before the next replaces it — no product visible yet.
- Problem (from `centered-phrase-relay-question-hook`): when the pain is an ordered chain of question/hook phrases that scale-pop through center relay-style (each exits as the next arrives) and land a specially-styled climax word — OR resolve the question on a `[product surface]` entering as an element move, never a camera zoom.
- Product_Intro (from `product-intro-kinetic-type-namedrop`): when the hook IS the words — hard-cut through "Introducing…" / tagline / value beats and resolve on the brand name or logo.
- Product_Intro (from `fixed-line-word-swap`): when a fixed headline holds and ONLY one word-slot changes — cursor-deleted-and-retyped once (optionally by a labeled collaborative cursor) or rapid-cycled through a `[role]` list — then hands off to the product/brand payoff; the purest sub-shape A.
- Product_Intro (from `flat-field-kinetic-word-run`): when a sentence builds word-by-word on a flat brand-color field and each `[hero word]` earns a bespoke one-shot effect payoff (letter-scramble, chromatic glitch, confetti burst, emoji morph) before a punch-word finale.
- Product_Intro (from `anchored-wordmark-transform`): when the anchored type itself mutates — an "Introducing" / predecessor beat builds or swaps into the `[wordmark]` in place, which then TRANSFORMS (a UI collage rushes outward from behind it, a word morphs into a pulsing icon, the title zoom-blurs away) into a short payoff beat.
- Benefits (from `benefits-kinetic-type`): when "what you get" is a rapid-fire staccato montage — 8–12 short value phrases, each flashing and clearing before the next at high tempo.
- Benefits (from `flat-void-statement-relay`): when the value reads as a SLOW statement relay — 2–4 full statements on a flat void, each built by its own engine (typewriter, oversized element-scroll, outline-echo stack, wave-mapped pattern) and held ~1.5s+ before the hard cut; the low-tempo sibling of the staccato montage.
- CTA (from `cta-kinetic-type`): when the sign-off is a punchy closing line (or a short stack of value lines) that snaps/fades in beat-by-beat and lands on the brand lockup or URL — no spatial set, no clicked button.
- CTA (from `kinetic-beat-chain-to-logo`): when the sign-off chains 3–5 message beats and each beat carries a DIFFERENT kinetic gag (marquee scroll-through, flash-swap word list, brief 3D letter extrude, spring-bounce prop, one interleaved mock-UI beat) before the logo/URL forms — optionally out of a preceding glow pulse — and holds.
- Brand_Outro (from `brand-outro-kinetic-type-resolve`): when the close is a rapid center-channel barrage of single-word verbs asserting breadth, resolving on the brand's one defining word (motion-is-the-message, no logo lockup).
- Brand_Outro (from `centered-beat-relay-to-url`): when the close is a short relay of full-frame beats — fade/scale swaps, a spring shrink-to-0, an `[icon]` bounce, a gradient-swept title card — terminating in a centered `[URL / domain]` end card held for the longest stretch of the shot (~40–75% of runtime); an optional `[product UI]` prologue scales down and fades to the canvas first.

**duration**: 3.0–12.9s (Benefits staccato fastest ~3.5–4s at 8–12 sub-0.5s beats, statement-relay Benefits up to ~8.3s; Product_Intro fixed-line as short as ~3.0s; Problem 4.1–12s; CTA spans 3.6–12.9s with beat count; Brand_Outro ~3.6s as a verb barrage, up to ~12.6s when the terminal URL hold carries 40–75% of the runtime)

**shot structure** (flat, fixed center anchor; bold sans-serif text on a solid `[bg color]`; type/tokens are the default subject, though a beat's payload may be ONE non-text center-stage element — a logo lockup, a CTA button, a chart — obeying the same arrive-hold-clear law; camera locked unless a modifier is noted; two folded sub-shapes — **(A) fixed-line token swap** and **(B) multi-beat statement build**)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.0s) — first beat lands.** Solid `[bg color]` field. Bold `[type color]` text arrives dead-center via ONE entrance: type-on character-by-character with a trailing blinking caret, OR a hard-cut FLASH-in (no fade/slide), OR a per-word staggered fade/blur, OR an oversized word that smoothly SCALES DOWN to a small centered word. An optional `[accent color]` move plays on the key word(s): a left→right drawn underline / strike-through, a small particle/dot burst from behind the text, or a `[accent color]` selection-box framing the word.
  - _Variant — Hook (flash)_: just the fixed `[hook line]` (or its first word) parks at center; no escalation move.
  - _Variant — Hook (escalation)_: `[beat 1 text]` arrives big and scale-downs to centered, OR sits over a glowing `[motif]` with a slow camera push-in (see camera modifier); ends on a hard cut.
  - _Variant — Hook (logo reveal)_: centered bold words swap in with quick spring-scale pops on a flat/gradient field while flat `[accent]` circles/dots drift idly; a beat may hard-cut to a contrast bg and enter with an RGB-split glitch stretch that snaps sharp.
  - _Variant — Hook (triptych)_: beat 1 may be non-text — a `[logo mark]` rotates in 3D and snaps flat beside a `[version tag]`, or a statement resolves via a horizontal stretch/slice glitch on a subtle `[grid card]` — holds, then clears (scale-down + fade, or hard cut).
  - _Variant — Problem_: centered `[pain line 1]` reveals in chunks across one or two lines with its `[accent]` underline / particle burst.
  - _Variant — Problem (relay)_: `[hook phrase 1]` scale-pops into center with a quick spring on a flat solid OR drifting-gradient field — optionally the background itself morphs open first (a rounded `[accent shape]` expands into the full-bleed gradient); as the phrase holds, its word-spacing spreads slightly.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: bold `[hook word, e.g. "Introducing"]` enters with a typographic accent (split-and-slide apart, drawn underline, or `[accent]` selection-box).
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (fixed-line)_: the full fixed headline `[fixed phrase] [swap-slot]` parks centered (a faint `[plexus / ambient pattern]` may drift behind); no escalation move — the slot is the show.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (word-run)_: a field-claiming open — horizontal `[brand color]` stripe wipes reveal the `[logo lockup]` then clear, or a giant blob expands from center repainting the frame in the brand color — before the sentence starts building.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (wordmark transform)_: "Introducing" fades in over ambient sine-wave lines that undulate then snap taut, OR the `[old version wordmark]` holds and swaps away, OR oversized scattered `[gradient]` letters bounce-assemble into the `[name]` while the whole word scales down to center.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: optional single-frame flash of `[product UI / hero asset]` precedes the verb channel, then `[verb 1]` hard-cuts in centered.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro (relay-to-URL)_: optional prologue — the `[product UI window]` scrolls its content, then scales down and fades out to the flat canvas; the first text beat fades/scales in centered.

- **Scene 2..N — beats replace each other in place (the engine).** The center anchor advances one beat at a time; nothing from the prior beat lingers. Choose the swap mechanism by sub-shape:
  - **Sub-shape A (fixed-line token swap)**: the line stays fixed and only the variable slot changes by an instant hard CUT (no roll/scroll/blur) — `[token A]` → `[token B]` → `[token C]` — OR the final word(s) backspace out and a new word retypes (`[word A]` → `[word B]`). The rest of the line holds. The cycle may run a rapid `[role word]` list at the fixed slot, and the delete-retype may be performed by a labeled collaborative cursor; a faint `[plexus / ambient pattern]` may keep drifting behind the fixed line.
  - **Sub-shape B (multi-beat statement build)**: each full-screen beat hard-cuts to a NEW background/line, and each gets its own distinct entrance/exit MOVE — springy scale-in/scale-out overshoot, 3D letter-tumble (glyphs scatter into a rotating depth cloud, then reassemble into the next phrase), motion-blur fly-in that resolves sharp at center, prior text accelerates/zooms past the camera while fading, letter-spacing collapse, or a bottom-up masked slide. Background may hard-flip `[bg A]`↔`[bg B]` on selected beats with `[type color]` inverting to stay legible.
  - _Variant — Hook (escalation)_: beat 2 `[beat 2 text]` (more emphatic) snaps in; beat 3 `[beat 3 text]` (climax) holds, then a transition-out move on the type itself — a Z-dolly forward THROUGH an oversized glyph, OR a per-word karaoke highlight sweep lighting words left→right.
  - _Variant — Hook (triptych)_: a mid beat may be non-text — a `[CTA button]` spring-pops with overshoot, fires a one-shot blurry glow-ring pulse outward, and settles smaller — the element alone on screen, then cleared like any other beat.
  - _Variant — Problem_: each `[pain line k]` enters by chunk-reveal or motion-blur fly-in as the prior blurs/zooms off; an optional `[accent color]` interstitial word ("[what-if hook]") scales up from center, holds, then zooms past the camera and fades.
  - _Variant — Problem (relay)_: each `[phrase]` scale-pops into center while the prior shrinks and split-slides off toward BOTH left/right edges (clipping off-screen) with fade; an optional emphasis beat lands on a hard-cut contrast bg — a single `[word]` letter-tracking-tightens from wide spacing while scaling up as four thin `[accent]` arrows shoot in diagonally from the corners, converging on it; a left-aligned line-by-line value build may interleave.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: each `[tagline phrase]` is a hard-cut/push-through inverted-text beat with its own one-shot accent (strike-through, slider/toggle shapes sliding in, or a bg-invert cycle white→`[accent]`→black flipping fg/bg).
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (word-run)_: the `[sentence]` builds word-by-word with snappy pops (lines re-center as they add; an underline may draw beneath key words), then one beat per `[hero word]` — each lands large and performs its own one-shot effect: a letter-scramble resolve (with thin divider ticks), a chromatic-glitch jitter (offset color copies snapping back clean), a spring bounce + confetti burst that erupts up and drifts down, or a letter-slot swapped for a springing `[emoji / mark]` that morphs; the finale may run an alternating huge/small word scale chain.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (wordmark transform)_: the `[wordmark]` completes in place — staggered part-by-part pop (`[part 1]` then `[part 2]`), an in-place swap replacing "Introducing", or a `[second phrase]` appending — with a gradient hue-sweep across the type that settles to a solid color snap.
  - _Variant — Benefits_: high tempo (~0.4s/beat) — each `[benefit phrase]` pops via springy scale-in/out or 3D letter-tumble; multiple bg light↔dark flips across the run with text-color invert.
  - _Variant — Benefits (statement relay)_: low tempo — each `[statement]` builds by its own engine and HOLDS ~1.5s+ before the hard cut: line 2 types char-by-char under a static line 1; an oversized `[phrase]` element-scrolls right→left through the frame (a moving window onto a wider line, a gradient sweeping the letters); a solid `[word]` holds while stacked outline-only echo copies cycle vertically behind it; a multi-line block builds fast as small `[accent shapes]` fly in from the edges then drift outward and thin (text may form as a masked grey fill, then snap solid).
  - _Variant — CTA_: each `[value line]` → `[value line]` → `[CTA verb line]` clears by hard cut / zoom-blur cut through near-black / fade-out, then the next pops/fades/slides in. Optional `[accent motif]` draws on behind (rising line-graph trim-path, thin wireframe guides, gutter geometry tiles).
  - _Variant — CTA (beat-chain)_: individual beats carry their own gag — a line enters right and marquee-scrolls continuously left across the frame (exiting); a `[use-case word]` list flash-swaps in place; a beat's letters briefly extrude into simple 3D and flatten back; a `[glyph + prop]` group spring-bounces in then slides off; ONE mock `[compose-window / product UI]` beat may interleave without breaking the chain.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: a centered single `[verb / keyword]` HARD-CUTS to the next at a steady ~0.2s cadence (no fade/scale) over a continuous moving field (see camera modifier).
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro (relay-to-URL)_: 2–3 full-frame beats swap wholesale at a relaxed cadence — each fades/scales in and out, or scales up slightly then spring-shrinks to 0%, or an `[icon]` bounce-pops in from 0% and shrinks back out, or a `[title card]` holds with a continuous in-text horizontal gradient sweep before a HARD CUT to the bare canvas.

- **Scene N (final beat → end) — resolve and HOLD.** The last beat lands and holds to the end (settle only, no further scale-out). Resolution diverges by role:
  - _Variant — Hook (flash)_: last token swap lands and holds; optional tiny punctuation/emphasis snap (`?` → `?!`, or fill snaps to `[accent color]`).
  - _Variant — Hook (escalation)_: resolve on `[payoff bg]` — a `[payoff element]` (colored square / heart-eyes reaction emoji) SPRING-POPS in center; small `[accent motes]` drift outward; subtle settle.
  - _Variant — Hook (logo reveal)_: the word beats resolve on the brand — the `[logo]` pops in whole, or floating 3D `[shapes]` assemble and FLATTEN into the flat 2D mark as the `[wordmark]` slides in beside it; then a `[browser mockup / value card]` slides/scales in on a fresh bg and holds (a bottom caption may build).
  - _Variant — Hook (triptych)_: the final beat may be non-text — a `[benchmark chart]` fades in its framework and grows bars from zero width in a top-down stagger (the `[hero row]` bold/highlighted), then holds static for the back half of the shot; or a closing statement glitch-reveals and holds.
  - _Variant — Problem_: final `[pain line]` reveals (left→right swipe with leading-edge blur, OR letters explode radially then the resolving line fades up); holds the pain on screen.
  - _Variant — Problem (relay)_: the climax `[word]` scales in with special treatment (gradient fill, slight ~-8° rotation) and holds — OR the question resolves on a `[product surface]` as an ELEMENT move: a `[pill / search bar]` slides in from the right and keeps traveling leftward while its text progressively reveals (may end mid-slide, phrase cropped at the frame edge), or the `[page canvas]` scales down while `[app chrome + side panels]` slide in and frame it.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: resolve on the brand — `[logo mark]` / `[wordmark]` pops in centered (optional sting: liquid/ink splash, blob backing), OR the final value word holds inside an expanding-iris `[accent]` circle that scales to fill frame and hard-cuts the closing word through it.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (wordmark transform)_: with the completed `[wordmark]` anchored dead-center, a dense `[UI-screenshot collage]` rushes in and expands outward from behind the text toward the frame edges with parallax (fast pull-back feel), then clears quickly to a clean `[wordmark]` end card; OR one `[word]` morphs into a pulsing `[icon]` completing an icon+text lockup before the field dissolves to its inverse; OR the title rapidly scales up and zoom-blurs away as the next context fades in.
  - _Variant — Benefits_: the last `[benefit phrase]` arrives (optionally on the inverted bg) and SETTLES — does not scale/tumble back out.
  - _Variant — CTA_: land on the lockup — `[logo mark]` SCALES UP small→full and holds, OR a `[logo]`/`[url]` builds segment-by-segment beside its icon. End-card holds dead static.
  - _Variant — CTA (glow-preceded formation)_: the prior letters scatter/clear, a soft `[accent]` glow pulses on the empty field, and the `[logo mark]` FORMS out of the glow with the `[url]` wordmark below; holds to the final frame.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: hard cut to the `[resolve word / brand keyword]` (longest, still centered); HOLDS ~0.5s while the background field keeps moving.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro (relay-to-URL)_: the centered `[URL / domain]` (+ optional CTA line above) fades/scales in and holds — the LONGEST beat of the shot, ~40–75% of the runtime — optionally fading at the very tail.

**rule mapping**

- hard-cut / flash word swaps, in-place token cycle, whole-line state swaps at time thresholds → `discrete-text-sequence`
- type-on character-by-character + blinking trailing caret → `discrete-text-sequence` (text/typing state progression) + `context-sensitive-cursor` (caret blink/color-switch)
- backspace-and-retype final word(s) → `discrete-text-sequence` (typos/holds/backspace is explicitly in-scope)
- one short distinct phrase per beat / script-driven phrase windows / word-by-word tagline assembly → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- percussive per-beat phrase entrances on a shared beat array (distinct entrance per phrase, steady cadence) → `kinetic-beat-slam` (best fit for the multi-beat statement-build engine and the ~0.2s Brand_Outro verb march)
- per-word staggered fade/blur reveal → `kinetic-beat-slam` (per-phrase/per-word distinct entrances); the soft-focus blur component → `depth-of-field-blur` (selective-focus blur on the off-focus words)
- big→small scale-down on a word; springy scale-in/scale-out overshoot → `spring-pop-entrance` (spring pop/settle) backed by `gsap-effects` for the plain scale tween
- 3D letter-tumble scatter-into-depth-cloud then reassemble → `depth-scatter-assemble` (glyphs scatter into a 3D depth cloud and reassemble into the next phrase; combine w/ `3d-text-depth-layers` for the extruded read, or `hacker-flip-3d` for an in-place per-char flip flavor)
- karaoke per-word highlight sweep synced across words → `asr-keyword-glow` (keyword glow+scale on a synced rail) OR `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep) — choose ASR-driven vs. static-timeline sweep
- drawn-on `[accent]` underline / strike-through / loop / scribble under key word → `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep / circle / burst / scribble / sketchout)
- particle/dot burst from behind text → `css-marker-patterns` (burst) backed by `gsap-effects`
- `[accent]` selection-box frame around a word → `css-marker-patterns` (circle/box marker) + `gsap-effects`
- bg-invert hard-flip (light↔dark / white→accent→black) with text-color invert → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-text/state swap covers the synchronized fg/bg state change)
- letter-spacing collapse; bottom-up masked slide → `gsap-effects` (tween letter-spacing / masked translate) + techniques: per-word kinetic typography / clip-path reveal
- expanding-iris circle wipe that morphs the current word into the next at the same center → `scale-swap-transition` (morph two elements at same center)
- final spring-pop payoff element (colored square / reaction emoji / logo mark) → `spring-pop-entrance` (or `physics-press-reaction` for a weightier pop)
- drifting `[accent]` motes / ambient shapes / soft drifting gradient field beneath the type → `sine-wave-loop` (idle drift loop)
- segment-by-segment URL / wordmark build beside its icon → `discrete-text-sequence` (segment-by-segment state reveal) or `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- final-token punctuation / emphasis snap (`?`→`?!`, fill→accent) → `discrete-text-sequence`
- settle-and-hold final frame → `spring-pop-entrance` (settle phase) / static hold (no rule needed)
- motion-blur fly-in / blur-off / zoom-through-camera streak on type → `motion-blur-streak` (directional velocity blur on a fast fly-in / zoom-through; the heavy motion-blur smear resolves sharp at center)
- radial letter-explode (glyphs explode outward radially then resolve) → `depth-scatter-assemble` (radial per-letter explode-and-resolve is in scope alongside the depth-cloud scatter)
- 3D letter-tumble depth-cloud scatter-and-reassemble → `depth-scatter-assemble` (free tumbling depth-cloud that flies out and snaps back into the next phrase)
- scale-pop phrase relay → `spring-pop-entrance` (the arriving phrase) + `gsap-effects` (the prior phrase's shrink + split-slide clear toward both edges)
- letter-tracking tighten-from-wide while scaling → `gsap-effects` (letter-spacing tween — the inverse of the letter-spacing collapse mapped above)
- corner arrows converging on a word → `css-marker-patterns` (burst geometry with inverted travel — lines converge instead of radiate) + `gsap-effects`
- gradient-fill climax word / hue-sweep across type / in-text traveling gradient sweep → `gradient-text-sweep` (gradient tweened THROUGH letterforms — position/hue sweep with settle-to-solid snap, seek-safe)
- background shape morph-open into a full-bleed field → `card-morph-anchor` (uniform scale + borderRadius paint tween, then the field takes over)
- RGB-split / chromatic-glitch jitter; horizontal stretch/slice glitch reveal → `chromatic-glitch` (deterministic offset color-copy layers, jitter + snap-clean; covers the stretch/slice glitch reveal)
- letter-scramble resolve with divider ticks → `hacker-flip-3d` (the deterministic glyph-substitution decode, minus the 3D rotation)
- 3D shapes assemble-and-flatten into the mark; scattered-letter bounce-assembly → `depth-scatter-assemble` (scatter-to-clean-layout settle) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the bounce settle)
- logo-lockup 3D rotation-snap → `orbit-3d-entry` (the 3D flip-in entry, skipping the orbit phase)
- one-shot glow-ring pulse; glow-pulse-preceded logo formation → `ambient-glow-bloom` (single-pass bloom-and-fade) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the mark forming out of it)
- chart framework fade-in + bars growing from zero width top-down; radial gauge arc-draw + count-up → `stat-bars-and-fills` (+ `counting-dynamic-scale` for the ticking value)
- labeled collaborative cursor delete-and-retype; in-place role-word cycle → `discrete-text-sequence` + `context-sensitive-cursor` (the labeled-pointer look itself is oversized-cursor doctrine, not a rule)
- ambient plexus/pattern drift; accent shapes drift-out-and-thin → `sine-wave-loop` (finite drift) after a `spring-pop-entrance` arrival
- letter-slot emoji/mark swap + morph; word→icon morph with continuous pulse → `scale-swap-transition` (same-center morph) + `svg-icon-enrichment` (the icon's internal pulse)
- oversized phrase element-scroll; right→left marquee scroll-through → `gsap-effects` (linear translate of an oversized element through a static frame)
- stacked outline-echo copies cycling behind a solid word → `3d-text-depth-layers` (the offset echo stack) + `vertical-spring-ticker` (the vertical cycle)
- brief 3D letter extrude-then-flatten → `3d-text-depth-layers` (build the extrusion offsets, then collapse them)
- full-frame repeating-word pattern on a rolling 3D wave → flagged special — a 3D wave-mapped text field is out of rule scope; `sine-wave-loop` only drives the undulation oscillator
- alternating huge/small word scale chain → `kinetic-beat-slam` (distinct per-beat entrances on the shared beat array)
- color-stripe wipes → `gsap-effects` (masked translate tweens); blob expand frame-repaint → `card-morph-anchor`
- UI-collage rush-out with parallax from behind anchored type → `center-outward-expansion` (clustered-at-center → outward to final positions; vary per-tile rates/scales for the parallax read)
- spring shrink-to-0 exit / bounce-in from 0% → `spring-pop-entrance` (in) / `gsap-effects` `back.in` shrink (out)
- product-surface resolve (pill slide with progressive text reveal; canvas scale-down as chrome frames in) → `nudge-curve` (the slide that reveals during travel) + `gsap-effects` (coordinated scale + panel slides)
- zoom-blur title exit as an in-shot beat handoff → `motion-blur-streak`; as a scene-out into the next scene it belongs to the transition layer
- staggered wordmark part pop / phrase append → `spring-pop-entrance` + `dynamic-content-sequencing`

**camera modifier** (optional, layered over the flat shot; most variants are camera-locked)

- Slow continuous global zoom-in / uniform push-in running underneath the whole sequence (Problem, Brand_Outro) → `multi-phase-camera` (push phase) — gives parallax between the fixed type and a moving background field.
- Camera dolly/zoom forward THROUGH an oversized glyph along Z as a beat transition-out (Hook escalation, Product_Intro push-through) → `coordinate-target-zoom` (target the glyph center) or `multi-phase-camera` (push).
- Slow push-in on Scene 1 over a glowing `[motif]` (Hook escalation) → `multi-phase-camera` (push) or `coordinate-target-zoom`.
- Slow continuous card/scene scale-up running UNDER hard-cut beats (Hook triptych) — a push-in feel rendered as element scale on the scene group, never a real dolly → `multi-phase-camera` (push phase) or a plain `gsap-effects` scale tween.
- Note: the in-place token swap (sub-shape A) and most Benefits/Hook-flash/CTA variants are fully camera-static — the swap is the only motion.

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Values

| token         | range                 | notes                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BASE_DURATION | 0.6–1.5s              | minimum per entry regardless of length — even one-word entries get read time                                          |
| SEC_PER_CHAR  | 0.03–0.06 s/char      | ≈17–33 chars/sec; uniform across the sequence so the pace reads as one engine; lean high for wide-character languages |
| HOLD_MID      | 0.5–1.0s              | dwell on a non-final entry; `< HOLD_FINAL`                                                                            |
| HOLD_FINAL    | 1.0–2.0s              | climax dwell — must exceed HOLD_MID by a clear margin so the close reads as a beat                                    |
| SPEED_FACTOR  | 0.5–2.0 (default 1.0) | per-entry only; if every entry shares a factor, fold it into SEC_PER_CHAR                                             |
| TAIL_PAD      | 0.0–1.0s              | quiet beat after the last entry; prefer 0 when the next composition owns the breath                                   |
| CONTENT N     | 3–6 entries           | <3 isn't a sequence; >6 drags (accelerating cadence relaxes this — see above)                                         |

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |

| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
